# SLAM
## Description:
In this project, I implemented mapping and localization in an indoor environment using information
from wheel encoders and range sensors. I integrated the wheel odometry information from a mobile
robot with a 2D laser range scanner (LIDAR) in order to build a 2D occupancy grid map of the walls and
obstacles in the environment. Training sets of odometry, inertial, and range measurements from a mobile
robot were used for this project.
