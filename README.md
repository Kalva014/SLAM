# SLAM
## Description:
In this project, I implemented mapping and localization in an indoor environment using information
from wheel encoders and range sensors. I integrated the wheel odometry information from a mobile
robot with a 2D laser range scanner (LIDAR) in order to build a 2D occupancy grid map of the walls and
obstacles in the environment. Training sets of odometry, inertial, and range measurements from a mobile
robot were used for this project.

## Set up:
1. Open SLAM.ipynb and in the second cell where we load the data, change the file paths to the files you want to test. E.g. for final testing we use the ECE5242Proj3-test-selected folder
2. Save and run all of the cells in the SLAM.ipynb folder
